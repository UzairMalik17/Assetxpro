          We are using security measures and encryption systems, to make sure
          interaction with our website is smooth and safe. All transactions are
          performed under secured protocols, using the username and password
          chosen and guarded by you; the chances of someone else trading in your
          name are extremely low..

        <p>
          Keeping your password safe: You should make sure that you don’t share
          the password with anyone and remember that AssetxPro ™ ’s personnel
          will never ask you for the password. If this happens and someone
          claims to be working for AssetxPro ™, don’t provide them with any
          information and make sure you notify our customer service at once.
          Pick a password that is hard to intercept and change it every couple
          of months. Also remember to log out as soon as you stop trading with
          AssetxPro ™, whenever you leave the computer and after every session.
          The first step to start trading is to open an account and this
          process, simple as it is, requires you to enter some personal data
          such as your first and last name, email and phone number. Additional
          details, as well as proof of identity may be required of you at any
          time. AssetxProl ™ will maintain the privacy of all your personal data
          we collect, including age, occupation or marital status. You may be
          required to provide the copies of ID, passport and photograph, in
          accordance with any policies, laws or regulations that require such
          documents to be delivered. Furthermore, in some jurisdiction you may
          also need to submit financial information, investment experience and
          risk tolerance, all as may be required under law.

          In order to have unrestricted access to the trading account and be
          able to trade with ease, these documents and information may be
          required. There is no obligation on your part to submit them, but if
          you don’t, you won’t be able to open the account and trade online.
          Additionally, it is important to keep us informed about your personal
          data as soon as something important changes, so your profile will
          always be up to date, and as required under any law.
