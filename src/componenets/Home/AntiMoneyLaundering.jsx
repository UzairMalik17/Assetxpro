      <p>
        AssetXPro ™ does not tolerate money laundering and supports the fight
        against money launderers. AssetXPro ™ follows the guidelines set by the
        UK’s Joint Money Laundering Steering Group. The UK is a full member of
        the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the intergovernmental body whose
        purpose is to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
      </p>
      <p>
        AssetXPro ™ now has policies in place to deter people from laundering
        money. These policies include:Ensuring clients have valid proof of
        identificationMaintaining records of identification
        informationDetermining that clients are not known or suspected
        terrorists by checking their names against lists of known or suspected
        terroristsInforming clients that the information they provide may be
        used to verify their identityClosely following clients’ money
        transactionsNot accepting cash, money orders, third party transactions,
        exchange houses transfers or Western Union transfers.Money laundering
        occurs when funds from an illegal/criminal activity are moved through
        the financial system in such a way as to make it appear that the funds
        have come from legitimate sources.
      </p>

        <p>
          Firstly, cash or cash equivalents are placed into the financial system
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, money is transferred or moved to other accounts (e.g.
          futures accounts) through a series of financial transactions designed
          to obscure the origin of the money (e.g. executing trades with little
          or no financial risk or transferring account balances to other
          accounts)And finally, the funds are re-introduced into the economy so
          that the funds appear to have come from legitimate sources (e.g.
          closing a futures account and transferring the funds to a bank
          account).Trading accounts are one vehicle that can be used to launder
          illicit funds or to hide the true owner of the funds. In particular, a
          trading account can be used to execute financial transactions that
          help obscure the origins of the funds.

        AssetXPro ™ directs funds withdrawals back to the original source of
        remittance, as a preventative measure.International Anti-Money
        Laundering requires financial services institutions to be aware of
        potential money laundering abuses that could occur in a customer account
        and implement a compliance program to deter, detect and report potential
        suspicious activity.These guidelines have been implemented to protect
        AssetXPro™ and its clients.For questions/comments regarding these
