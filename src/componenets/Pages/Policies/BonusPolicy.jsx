            1. Definition of a trading bonus: A trading bonus is an added value
            that matches your deposit in your AssetXPro ™ Trading Account and it
            provides you with more funds to use when you are trading. Trading
            bonuses come in many forms; there are consistent deposit matches
            which means that your account will be given an added value when you
            deposit funds over and over again; and it also comes in the form of
            a one-time added value on your first deposit. The Company offers
            these bonus funds. When you fund your account, the Company matches
            your first real money deposit by a certain amount of percentage in
            accordance to your first deposit.
          </li>

            1. Warning: A trading bonus gives you great value and extra trading
            leverage. With all of the above being mentioned; when you trade with
            bonus leverage you need to be cautious. Leverage is a valuable
            trading tool, but you need to be aware of the downside. You may
            close higher trades and make more money initially (or in the long
            run), but you can also lose a lot more money. Option trading can be
            risky and you need to trade with confidence and responsibility to
            avoid losses.

          <li>
            After receiving the sign up bonus, traders are given several other
            opportunities to boost their account balance. The Company often
            offers a “broker bonus” before significant financial events to
            enable traders to take advantage of the market volatility around
            those times. The Company also offers “no deposit bonus” for VIP
            account holders. These “no deposit bonuses” are called “rebate
            bonuses”, since they are based on a percentage of the trader’s
            trading volume. A rebate bonus is usually given on a monthly basis
            and it’s the Company’s way of giving back a percentage of the
            traders’ investment that month. A “risk free trade” is also
            categorized as a bonus as per this agreement and may be offered by
            the company at its sole discretion.
